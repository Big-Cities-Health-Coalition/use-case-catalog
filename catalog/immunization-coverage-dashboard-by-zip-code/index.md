## The problem

Coverage estimates arrived once a year, too late to steer outreach.

## What we built

An R script that aggregates the weekly registry extract to ZIP code and suppresses small cells, and a Power BI report on top of it.

## Time and resources

About six weeks of analyst time.

## Lessons learned

Agree on small-cell suppression rules with the privacy officer before building the visuals.
