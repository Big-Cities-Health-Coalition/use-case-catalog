We started posting wastewater trends by hand in 2024 and kept missing rises that were obvious in hindsight. The pipeline is a scheduled Python job. It pulls the weekly lab export for each plant, normalizes the results for flow, fits a seasonal baseline per plant and per target from two seasons of history, and runs a simple changepoint test that flags a sustained two-sample rise above the baseline's expected band. The thresholds are written down and were set by the epi team, so anyone can check why a flag fired.

The last step is small. A language model turns the flagged numbers into a two-sentence note, and an epidemiologist approves it before it posts. That review matters: about one flag in five is a sampling artifact, and the reviewer catches those in under a minute.

Setup for another jurisdiction means pointing the ingest at your lab export, setting plant service-area names, and loading two seasons of history for the baseline. Most of the work is the ingest adapter. The alert prompt comes with the code and is deliberately boring: it restates numbers the pipeline computed and never speculates about causes. If a model is hard to get approved where you are, a fixed text template does the same job.
