## The problem

Every new lab took weeks of back-and-forth before its messages loaded cleanly, and epidemiologists spent time fixing malformed segments by hand.

## What we built

A validation and mapping pipeline that runs on each test batch, returns a plain-language error report to the lab, and loads clean messages into staging.

## Time and resources

One developer for four months, plus an epidemiologist to review the mapping tables.

## Lessons learned

Send the lab the error report directly. Most problems were fixed on their side within a day once they could see them.
